title: Spec & Handles
---
import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The generated tests are split into two types of files: The "spec" file and the "handles" file. 

The spec file is auto generated and contains the actual tests and this is where you **run** your tests. The handles file is where you **implement** the tests.


In this section we will go through how to work with these files and what they do. But more on how to
implement the tests in the tutorials section.
<FileTree>
- src
  - main.spec.ts *Spec file*
  - main.ts *Handles file*
</FileTree>

## Spec

The spec file is auto generated and reflects the flowchart from FigJam
It contains the actual tests:

```typescript
test('my awesome test', async ({ page, context }) => {
  const gateways: GatewayCollection = {}
  const state = await handles.setup({ gateways, page, context } as any)
  const args = { gateways, state, page, context } as any
  await handleServiceCalls(args)
  await handles.start(args)

  await handles.test_testingSomethingHere(args)
})
```
This is how a test will look like in playwright and from this file you will find a little play button
next to the test where you can run the test.

It also contains the typescript definition for all the test implementations
```typescript
export type Main<TState={}, TPageExtensions={}> = {
  setup: (args: Omit<TestArgs<TState, TPageExtensions>, 'state'>) => Promise<TState>
  start: (args: TestArgs<TState, TPageExtensions>) => Promise<void>
  test_testingSomethingHere: (args: TestArgs<TState, TPageExtensions>) => Promise<void>
}
```

## Handles

The handles file is where you implement the tests.
This file is not auto generated and you will have create a file named `main.ts` in the same directory as the spec file.
To get started you can copy and paste the following code into your `main.ts` file.

```typescript
import {Main} from './main.spec.js'

export const handles: Main = {
    setup: async function () {
        return {}
    },
    start: async function ({page}) {
        await page.goto('/index.html')
    },
}
```

This file will then be added on with you implementations of all your tests, user actions and service calls.

## Workflow

When working with these files you will have to keep track of two files.
<FileTree>
  - main.spec.ts *This is where you run your tests*
  - main.ts *This is where you implement your tests*
</FileTree>

So best practise is to have a window with the spec file open and a window with the handles file open.
And to way to keep track of what node you are actually testing you can also look at your figma flow
to get a better visual representation of what you are testing.

#### Now you are ready to get started!!!
